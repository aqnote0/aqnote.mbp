This package consists of a script and the binary files to install
firmware for b43 and b43legacy on systems that do not have network
access in Linux.

If you are reading this, you have already downloaded the source
file for this system, copied it to Linux, and unpacked the tarball.

The only thing left to do is run the script using

sudo ./install_bcm43xx_firmware_no_net

The script will install the firmware. At this time, you should reboot
the system. When it comes back up, your b43 or b43legacy device should
be ready for configuration.
